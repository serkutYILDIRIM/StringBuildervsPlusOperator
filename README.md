As you can see, concatenating strings using StringBuilder is much faster, consumes much less memory, and uses fewer garbage collections in all generations, compared to using the "+" operator to strings.

Note that, regular string concatenations are faster than using the StringBuilder but only when you’re using a few of them at a time. 𝐈𝐟 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐰𝐨 𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐧𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬, 𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐚 + 𝐨𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫.

StringBuilder will improve performance in cases where you make repeated modifications to a string or concatenate many strings together.
